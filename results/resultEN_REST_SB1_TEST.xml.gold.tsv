– The sushi here is perfectly good, but for $5 a piece, either the slices of fish should be larger, or there should be no pretense that this is a moderately priced restaurant (even for NYC).	positive sushi | negative restaurant | negative sushi | negative sushi                                                                                                                 	 positive sushi | negative slices of fish | negative restaurant
I'm astonished that this restaurant is categorized as $$$ rather than $$$$.	negative restaurant                                                                                                                            	 negative restaurant

In other words, if they aren't making $$ off of you then you don't rate high on their'service scale'.	negative service                                                                                                                            	 negative service

While this diner had reasonably good food, the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence, and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service.	positive food | negative restaurant staff                                                                                                                        	 positive food | negative restaurant staff | negative service
After one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress, a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant.	negative waitress                                                                                                                           	 negative waitress

Though, one thing I realized later on was that the restaurant either used MSG or a meat tenderizer on the steak.	negative steak                                                                                                                           	 negative restaurant

On my meal I had to send back my eggs for a simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking, and would have had to send them back again if I hadn't rejected the meal all together.	negative eggs | negative meal                                                                                                                       	 negative meal     
I rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and I was too frustrated to continue.	negative dish                                                                                                                            	 negative eggs    
To their credit they removed the dish from the check; but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was.	negative manager                                                                                                                            	 negative dish     
In the end our check came to $27 for 4 small pancakes, a breakfast burrito, an orange juice and an iced tea (I had water).	negative pancakes | negative pancakes | negative breakfast burrito | negative orange juice | negative iced tea                                                                                                   	 negative pancakes | negative breakfast burrito | negative orange juice | negative iced tea

– I am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at Ray's Boathouse last Friday completely exceeded my expectations.	positive Ray's Boathouse                                                                                                                         	 positive Ray's Boathouse                 
Ray's is something of a Seattle institution, but given its gorgeous Sound views, I had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service.	positive Sound views                                                                                                                            	 positive scenery | positive food | positive service

My party of two was feeling particularly ambitious, and we splurged on the Shilshole Sampler...a beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns, smoked albacore tuna, Ray's fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill, scallops in a tasty soy dressing, and a tiny pile of Dungeness crab atop a sublime butter sauce.	positive white gulf prawns | positive manila clams | positive soy dressing | positive butter sauce | positive Shilshole Sampler | positive Shilshole Sampler                                                                                         	 positive Shilshole Sampler | positive white gulf prawns | positive smoked albacore tuna | positive smoked salmon in a positive soy dressing | positive Dungeness crab
For my entr&eacute;e, I completely enjoyed the seared Alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard, artichoke hearts, fennel, and pecorino toscano.	positive seared Alaskan sea scallops | positive seared Alaskan sea scallops                                                                                                          	 positive seared Alaskan sea scallops | positive chard | positive artichoke hearts | positive fennel | positive pecorino toscano          
The scallops are apparently cooked in a black olive butter which really makes them unique (not to mention tasty).	positive scallops | positive scallops                                                                                                                        	 positive scallops | positive black olive butter

Our server continued to be attentive throughout the night, but I did remain puzzled by one issue: Who thinks that Ray's is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner?	positive server | neutral Ray's                                                                                                                        	 positive server | negative Ray's
